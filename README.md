# Members Only

[This project](https://members-only-6du2.onrender.com/) was created to showcase my acquired backend knowledge. The goal of this project was to create a simple message board where people can sign up and enter passcodes to gain special priviledges. Anyone that isn't logged in can only view messages, however they won't be able to see the authors. Logged in users that haven't entered the super secret passcodes will, in addition to seeying the messages, be able to post new ones. Users that have entered the said passcode will be able to see the author of each message. There is also a _very_ complex passcode that grants admin priviledges - deletion of messages.

For the sake of you, kind users, trying out my humble project, I shall provide you with the passcode that allows you to view authors. The passcode is _caufield_, as in [Cole Caufield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Caufield) of the Montr√©al Canadiens.

Styling of the project is very simplistic as the main focus was on the backend side of things, not frontend.
